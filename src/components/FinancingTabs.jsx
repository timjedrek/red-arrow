              We do initial underwriting within 1-2 hours. If all documents
              required are submitted to us, we process and prepare the final
              loan documents within one (1) day. We fund the loan within three
              (3) business days after all parties have signed the loan
              documents.

              We only require applicants to complete the Loan Application Form
              to apply. Once you have filled it out, we would determine if the
