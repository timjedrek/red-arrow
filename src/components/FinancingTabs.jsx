              What factors does Stratus Financial consider?
            </p>
            <p>
              We base our loan approval on the borrower and co-borrower’s (e.g.
              parents, siblings, friends) merit on the following:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
              <li>FICO score</li>
              <li>Current income while in school</li>
              <li>Assets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We can consider 2 out of 3 of these factors depending on the
              borrower's financial capacity.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold pt-5">
              How soon can I be approved for my loan?
            </p>
            <p>
              We do initial underwriting within 1-2 hours. If all documents
              required are submitted to us, we process and prepare the final
              loan documents within one (1) day. We fund the loan within three
              (3) business days after all parties have signed the loan
              documents.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold pt-5">
              Will there be a penalty for paying off the loan early in the
              future?
            </p>
            <p>You may repay the loan in whole or in part without penalty.</p>
            <p className="font-semibold pt-5">
              Are there any prerequisites to applying for a loan? (e.g. is it a
              pre-requisite to have a co-signer?)
            </p>
            <p>
              We only require applicants to complete the Loan Application Form
              to apply. Once you have filled it out, we would determine if the
              information you provided would require you to have a co-borrower
              to qualify.
